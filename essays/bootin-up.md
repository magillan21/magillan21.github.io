## The Frustration is Real
In order to begin developing skills in front end development, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the potential of pure CSS and HTML. Throughout my courses, I have only been involved in utilizing the core principles of CSS and HTML to construct websites and build a stable foundational knowledge. Just as I was starting to become comfortable with these concepts, we began investing our time in UI frameworks. Bootstrap 5 builds off the elements I learned and expands upon them in ways that initially felt overwhelming, but ultimately proved to be a good extension on everything I had worked to understand.

## Why Not Just Use Raw HTML and CSS?

Writing everything from scratch is time-consuming. In order to build even a basic responsive layout using only HTML and CSS, it is necessary to manually manage a lot more compared to Bootstrap 5 which handles things automatically through its grid system and utility classes. Throughout my experience building pages by hand, I found myself rewriting the same patterns over and over. Bootstrap removes that repetition and replaces it with a consistent, reusable system that allows you to focus on what you are actually building rather than how to make a button look the same on every screen size.

It is important to acknowledge that Bootstrap 5 is not simple. Much like learning a new programming language, it requires time and patience to internalize its logic. Throughout my early use of the framework, I found myself referencing the documentation constantly and second-guessing whether I was using it correctly. However, as I continued to build with it, the structure began to make sense. Bootstrap 5 builds off the foundational CSS knowledge I already had, and once that connection clicked, the learning curve flattened.

## Benefits 
In order to grow as a front end developer, it is necessary to move beyond raw HTML and CSS and engage with the tools that professionals actually use. Bootstrap 5 provides speed, consistency, and built-in responsiveness that would take significantly longer to achieve from scratch. Throughout this course, my understanding of front end development has expanded because of frameworks like Bootstrap. The frustration of learning something new is part of the process, and the skills I've gained have been worth the effort.
