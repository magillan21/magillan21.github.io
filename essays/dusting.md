## What were my standards before?
Before this class, I saw coding standards as how many spaces to use or where to put curly braces. I knew I should comment on my code and indent properly, but I wasn’t very strict as long as the code worked. Using ESLint this week changed how I think about coding standards.

## High standards are always bettern than low ones!
When I first used ESLint, it was stressful. There were an overwhelming amount of red lines showing errors and warnings. And sometimes the errors were about small things I never worried about before. Installing and setting it up for each project also took time, and I often had to troubleshoot. I was pretty irritated at first because it felt way too nitpicky.


But after a while, I started to come around. ESLint made me pay attention to the different and cleaner ways you could write code; I had to fix spacing, naming, and even the way the code functioned. These things looked minor, but they made my code cleaner and easier to read. When my code is organized, it’s also easier to find mistakes and understand later. And I do agree that coding standards can help you learn a language. ESLint can teach you good habits and show what is considered good practice. It’s like having a guide that corrects you while you learn. Overall, using ESLint can be a hassle, but I can see the long-term benefits. It’s painful at first, but useful in the end.
