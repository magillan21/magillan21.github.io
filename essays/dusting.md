## What were my standards before?
Before this class, I saw coding standards as how many spaces to use or where to put curly braces. I knew I should comment on my code and indent properly, but I wasn’t very strict as long as the code worked. As long as things functioned and it looked readable, what more could people ask for? Especially if I was doing timed work, cleaning up my code was the last thing on my mind. Using ESLint this week changed how I think about coding standards.

## High standards are always better than low ones!
When I first used ESLint, it was stressful. There were an overwhelming amount of red lines showing errors and warnings, and sometimes the errors were about small things I never worried about before; I never knew I had to leave a space after my last line of code! Even more challenging was the ordeal of installing and setting it up for each project--I often had to troubleshoot. I was pretty irritated at first because it felt way too nitpicky and unnecessary. 

But after a while, I started to come around. ESLint made me pay attention to the different and cleaner ways you could write code; I had to fix spacing, naming, and even the way the code functioned. These things looked minor, but they made my code cleaner and easier to read. When my code is organized, it’s also easier to find mistakes and understand later. And I do agree that coding standards can help you learn a language. ESLint can teach you good habits and show what is considered good practice. It’s like having a guide that corrects you while you learn. Overall, using ESLint can be a hassle, but I can see the long-term benefits. It’s painful at first, but useful in the end.
